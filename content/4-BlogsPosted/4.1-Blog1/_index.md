Hello everyone!

When I first started learning Amazon Web Services (AWS), I thought I should begin with popular services such as Amazon EC2 or Amazon S3. However, after spending time studying and gaining hands-on experience, I realized that **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is actually the most fundamental AWS service.

The reason is simple: almost every AWS service depends on proper access management. Without a solid understanding of IAM, it is easy to encounter permission-related issues or unintentionally introduce security risks.

In this article, I would like to share the fundamentals of IAM along with the key lessons I learned while studying this service.

# What is IAM?

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the AWS service that enables you to securely manage identities and control access to AWS resources.

IAM answers three fundamental questions:

- Who is allowed to access the system?
- What actions are they allowed to perform?
- Which AWS resources are they allowed to access?

Instead of using the AWS account root user for everyday operations, AWS recommends using IAM users or IAM roles with appropriate permissions to improve security.

# Core Components of IAM

## IAM User

An IAM user represents an individual person or an application that requires access to AWS resources.

Each individual should have their own IAM user because it allows you to:

- Simplify user management.
- Track user activities through audit logs.
- Revoke permissions when access is no longer required.

---

## IAM Group

An IAM group is a collection of IAM users who share the same permissions.

Examples include:

- Developers
- DevOps
- Administrators

When an IAM user is added to a group, the user automatically inherits all permissions assigned to that group.

This approach makes permission management much simpler than assigning permissions individually to each user.

---

## IAM Policy

An IAM policy is a JSON document that defines a set of permissions.

For example, a policy can allow users to:

- Read data from Amazon S3.
- Start or stop Amazon EC2 instances.
- View logs in Amazon CloudWatch.

IAM policies can be attached to IAM users, IAM groups, or IAM roles to control access to AWS resources.

---

## IAM Role

Unlike an IAM user, an IAM role does not represent a specific person. Instead, it provides temporary permissions to AWS services or applications.

For example:

- An Amazon EC2 instance needs permission to read data from Amazon S3.
- An AWS Lambda function needs permission to write logs to Amazon CloudWatch.

Instead of storing access keys inside an application, Amazon EC2 or AWS Lambda can assume an IAM role to obtain temporary credentials securely.

---

# The Principle of Least Privilege

One of the most important security principles when working with IAM is the **Principle of Least Privilege**.

This principle means granting only the permissions that a user or service actually needs to perform its tasks—nothing more.

For example:

- A developer responsible only for application deployment should not have permission to delete Amazon S3 buckets.
- A data analyst may require read-only access to data without permission to modify or delete it.

Applying this principle significantly reduces security risks if an account is compromised or permissions are misused.

# What I Learned

After working with IAM, I realized that it is much more than a service for creating user accounts. It is the foundation for building secure, well-managed AWS environments.

Some of the lessons I learned include:

- Never use the AWS account root user for daily operations.
- Assign permissions through IAM groups instead of directly to individual users.
- Always grant only the permissions that are required.
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys for applications running on AWS.
- Regularly review and remove unnecessary permissions.

These are also considered AWS security best practices for production environments.

# Conclusion

IAM was the first AWS service I chose to learn because it serves as the security foundation for nearly every service in the AWS ecosystem.

A solid understanding of IAM not only helps you manage identities and permissions effectively but also prepares you to work with other AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon CloudWatch.

In my next article, I will introduce **AWS CloudTrail**, the AWS service that records account activity and API events, helping organizations monitor operations, perform audits, and investigate security incidents.

Thank you for taking the time to read this article. If you have any suggestions or experiences with AWS IAM, I would be happy to discuss them in the comments.
